# Supervised Learning -- CW2
Initialisation


Multiclass classification methods:
One against all: 
  -- requires multiple training sessions
  -- slower prediction
  
  
Classification methods - Not perceptron:

SVM -- hard to implement, 
Multiclass Logistic Regression
Random Forrest - (maybe not a good idea)
Neural Net
Nearest Neighbours
Naive Bayes
